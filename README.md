# ChessEngine
# This is my first python project so please forgive any javaisms that have bled into my python programming.
# Make moves by specifying the row and column of the piece you want to move and the row and column of the square you want to move it to. 
# Write these in the console in the form: oldRow, oldColumn, newRow, newColumn
