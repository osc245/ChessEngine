# ChessEngine
This is my first python project so please forgive any javaisms that have bled into my python programming.
Make moves by specifying the row and column of the piece you want to move and the row and column of the square you want to move it to. 
Write these to the console in the form: oldRow, oldColumn, newRow, newColumn
